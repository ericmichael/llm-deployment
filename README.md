# AI Starter Kit

Brief description of your project.

## Prerequisites

- Python (version)
- Django (version)
- Node.js (version 14.0.0 or later)
- npm (version 6.0.0 or later)

## Setup

### Node.js and npm Setup

Before you can install the JavaScript dependencies, you need to install Node.js and npm. Here's how you can install them on different operating systems:

#### Windows and macOS

1. Download the Node.js installer from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).
2. Run the installer and follow the prompts to install Node.js and npm.

#### Ubuntu

1. Update your package list:

    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    ```

2. Install Node.js and npm:

    ```bash
    sudo apt install nodejs npm
    ```

3. Verify the installation:

    ```bash
    node -v
    npm -v
    ```

    This should print the versions of Node.js and npm.

### Django Setup

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/username/project.git
    cd project
    ```

2. Install the Python dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the Django migrations:

    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

4. Start the Django development server:

    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

### JavaScript and Webpack Setup

1. In the root of your project, you should find a `package.json` file. This file contains all the necessary dependencies for the JavaScript part of your project.

2. Install the JavaScript dependencies by running:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    This command will install all the dependencies listed in `package.json`.

3. To bundle your JavaScript files and make them ready for production, you can use the build script defined in `package.json`. Run the following command:

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

    This will create a bundled JavaScript file using Webpack, which you can include in your Django templates.
